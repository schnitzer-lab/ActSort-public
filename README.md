ActSort is an active learning accelerated cell sorter tool for calcium imaging, which automates the quality control process of cell extraction. It is a standalone quality control pipeline that can be used to annotate cell candidates extracted by cell extraction algorithms. If you are interested in cell extraction, see [EXTRACT](https://github.com/schnitzer-lab/EXTRACT-public)!

The figure on the right depicts an example cell annotation instance and is taken from our pre-print. The half-hemisphere is imaged through a 7mm x 7mm window with our custom wide-field fluorescence macroscope. Slightly more than 11k cell candidates were found using EXTRACT, and later sorted by human annotators. Green circles represent actual cells, whereas red circles represent cell candidates returned by EXTRACT but rejected by the human annotators.
